# grep commands

# to extract a scaffold from a genome:
# Note - this extracted the whole scaffold. 
find . -name "tc_171026.fa" | xargs grep -E '>scaffold2239,*' -A 1 > scaffold_2239

# But this did NOT extract the whole transcript. :( 
find . -name "WBPS15gff3_pep.fasta" | xargs grep -E '*-0002' -A 1 > Second_transcripts
# I think because the genome file has the scaffold on a single line, while the fasta file from Roz reads it as separate lines. 
# Instead - use the command above to get the names of the genes:

# Then take this genelist and do the following:
while read NAME; do samtools faidx WBPS15gff3_pep.fasta ${NAME} >> \
Second_transcript_WBPS15gff3_pep.fasta; done < \
Second_transcripts_GENELIST.txt

To get contig 7 extracted: 
awk '/>7$/,/>8$/' tc_171026.renamed.fa > scaffold_7
find . -name "WBPS15gff3_pep.fasta" | awk '/>*-00002$/,/>-00003$/' > Second_transcripts_b

# To try to get ALL (head and non-head) contig 7 SNPs into a text file for plotting in R, to do for 4to6 
# (note the ^ means it has to be at hte start of a line, the $ and the \t means it has a tab straight after the 7 and the ' ' means that exact phrase:

grep $'^7\t' poolseq.mc5.fst_4to6.igv > contig7_4to6.fst.igv
