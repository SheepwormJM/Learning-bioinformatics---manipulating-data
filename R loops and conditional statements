# Make an iterative loop combined with a conditional statement:

for (i in 1:10)
  { if (i > 2 && i < 7) print (i) }
  
# The loop says that for all numbers of 1:10, if they are >2 and <7 then to print them.

# How about if you are doing RNA-Seq and you want sig genes with log2FC > x?
# Make a conditional statement:

if (padj < 0.05 && log2FC >1) {print ("significant")}
