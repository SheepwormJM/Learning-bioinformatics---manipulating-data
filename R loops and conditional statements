# Make an iterative loop combined with a conditional statement:

for (i in 1:10)
  { if (i > 2 && i < 7) print (i) }
  
# The loop says that for all numbers of 1:10, if they are >2 and <7 then to print them.

# How about if you wanted just even numbers?
# if I divide two numbers using % instead of / it returns the REMAINDER.
# E.g.
# 9 %% 2 # will return 1
# 8 %% 2 # will return 0
for (i in 1:10)   { if ((i %% 2) == 0) { print (i)} }


# How about if you are doing RNA-Seq and you want sig genes with log2FC > x?
# Make a conditional statement:

if (padj < 0.05 && log2FC >1) {print ("significant")}

# Can have some fun: 
x = 10
if (x > 0) {print("I am bigger than zero")}
if (x < 0) {print("I am smaller than zero")}
if (x != 0) {print("I am not zero")}
if (x > 0) {print("I am zero")}
# Note, if try this with a vector it will just use the first entry in the vector and throw up a warning message telling you so.
# Also - the above expressions will only print something if TRUE. If not true they will print nothing at all.
