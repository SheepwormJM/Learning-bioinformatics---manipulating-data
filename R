# Using R:

# Loading a table into R using read.table():
file = path to the file you want to open
sep = what character acts to separate the columns in your file. Usually \t or ,
header = true / false, do you want the first row of your file to become the names of the columns in the data.frame
row.names = which column do you want to be the row names in the data frame

# If you want R to see data as data e.g. FALSE vs TRUE as opposed to just a txt string, then it needs to be a 'factor'.
# To check the level order of a factor do:
levels(table$column)
# If x were table$significant, the output would “False” “True”
# To change the order use e.g:
table$column = factor(table$column,levels= c("True","False"))
# If x were table$significant, the order would now be “True” “False”

# To select part of a table (data frame):

table[1,] # Select the first row
row = table[1,] # Select the first row and store in variable
col = table[,1] # Select the first column and store in variable
table[1,1] # Select the first row and column
table[1:3,1:3] # Select the first 3 rows and columns
table[c(1,2,4,7),] # Select an assortment of rows
rows_to_select = c(1,2,3,6,7) # Select an assortment of rows and columns using variables
cols_to_select = c(1,4,5)
table[rows_to_select,cols_to_select]

# Or, you could use the row or column titles:
table[“ENSG00000282221”,] # Select the first row
table[,”mean_expression”] # Select the first column
table[“ENSG00000282221”,”mean_expression”] # Select the first row and column
cols_to_select = c(“log2fold”,”p”,”chromosome”) # Select several columns using a variable
table[,cols_to_select]

# A vector is a single row or a single column - i.e. a 1D thing. 
# In contrast a table (data frame) is a 2D things - rowS and columnS

# To make a vector use c():
new_vector = c(“coding”,”coding”,”miRNA”,”miRNA”,”coding”,”lincRNA”,”coding”,”coding”,”coding”,”psuedo”)
another_new_vector = c(“ENSG0000012”,156.12,11,5677858,5685034,-1.56,0.00123,”True”,”True”)
# To add a new column to a dataframe can do:
table$name_for_new_column = new_vector
# Note that the new column must have the same number of rows as the dataframe itself.


# To REMOVE rows or columns from a dataframe can do the same as to select, but add a '-' sign:
table_trimmed = table[,-1] # removes first column
table_trimmed = table[-1,] # removes first row
table_trimmed = table[-c(1,2,3),] # removes first three rows

# To REMOVE rows or colums from a data frame using logicals do:
columns_to_remove = c(“HC_6”,”HC_8”)
names(table) # this returns the header row as a vector
names(table) %in% columns_to_remove # this returns “True”, “False”, “True”, “False”, “False”, “False”, “False”
table_new = table[, !names(table) %in% columns_to_remove] # as a one liner, removes the 2 columns
# it selects the columns NOT in
# columns_to_remove
table_new = table[!row.names(table) %in% rows_to_remove,] # equivalent for rows

# How would I select only the significant genes?
DE_table = read.table(file="DE_table_file.csv", header=TRUE, row.names = 1, sep='\t')
DE_table_sig = subset(DE_table, p.adj < 0.05)

# How would I select only the significant genes but save only the gene ID?
DE_table = read.table(file="DE_table_file.csv", header=TRUE, row.names = 1, sep='\t')
DE_table_sig_IDs = subset(DE_table, p.adj < 0.05)$ID

# The function subset() is for selecting data that is identical to a certain 'thing' or that meets certain requirements: 
table_subset = subset(table, chromosome == 1) # select only rows with chromosome 1
table_subset = subset(table, log2fold > 0) # select only rows with positive fold
table_subset = subset(table, log2fold > 0 & p < 0.05) # select only significant rows with positive fold

# To re-order rows or columns use:
# Option 1. By index.
# If we supply a list of column or row indexes to the data frame the resulting order will be as the list. Obviously
# this will also remove any rows/ columns that aren’t included the order list.
new_order = c(5,4,3,2,1)
table_row_ordered = table[new_order,] # Makes a table of the first 5 rows in reverse order
table_col_ordered = table[,new_order] # Makes a table of the first 5 columns in reverse order

# Option 2. By ID.
# Exactly as above, but ordering by id
new_order = c(“replicate_5”, “replicate_4”, “replicate_3”, “replicate_2”, “replicate_1”)
table_row_ordered = table[new_order,] # Makes a table of the first 5 rows in reverse order
table_col_ordered = table[,new_order] # Makes a table of the first 5 columns in reverse order

# Note, can also use the above to duplicate a column - e.g. new_order = c(1,1,1,1)

# To SORT data by values in a column: 
# We can also formally sort all rows / columns by value.
order(my_table$p) # returns a list of ROW INDEXES for the rows sorted by column p.
my_table_sorted = [order(my_table$p),] # sorts the rows by value of p coumn


# To RE-NAME column headers or row names:
# Columns
names(table) = c(“HC1”,”HC2”,”HC3”,”HC4”,”HC5”,”HC6”,”HC7”) # supply a new list of names
# Rows
row.names(table) = c(“gene1”,”gene2”,”gene3”,“gene4”,”gene5”,”gene6”,“gene6”,”gene7”,”gene8”,”gene9”)

# To combine tables by adding additional columns, or additional rows:

# By Column:
# Assumes the rows are the same and adds table 2 as a series of new columns to table 1.
combined_table = cbind(table1,table2)
# By Row:
# Assumes the column headers are the same in each table (and same order?) and adds table 2 as new rows below table 1.
combined_table = rbind(table1,table2)

# How would I merge the expression and differential expression tables?
DE_table = read.table(file="DE_table_file.csv", header=TRUE, row.names = 1, sep='\t')
E_table = read.table(file="E_table_file.csv", header=TRUE, row.names = 1, sep='\t')
merged_data = merge(DE_table, E_table, by=0)
# Note, that, in the above line, by=0 represents the row names. Could also put by="ID", or by="SHEEP_ID" etc.
# Note that in order to merge two tables, the column header must be the SAME in each table.
# The default behaviour of merge() is to keep only rows that are the same in both tables. 


## I'm melting! I'm melting!
# To get a table to change from:
Sheep_ID  FEC_1  FEC_2
Sheep_1 100 53  
Sheep_2 300 23

# To:
Sheep_ID  FEC Value
Sheep_1 1 100
Sheep_1 2 53
Sheep_2 1 300
Sheep_2 2 23

# Then you want to MELT the table:
install.packages(“reshape2”)
table_melted = melt(table)

# I think it will melt every column, keeping the first column as was (but obiously with many more rows), and all additional
# columns will become under col_2, with their row values under col_3.

### Other useful functions:
nrow(table) # gets the number of rows in the data frame
ncol(table) # gets the number of columns in the data frame
head(table,n) # returns the first n rows
tail(table,n) # returns the last n rows
t(table) # transposes the data frame *but returns a matrix.
data.frame(table) # casts a matrix into a data frame
table_transposed = data.frame(t(table)) # transpose and cast back
cor(table) # returns a matrix of correlations
names(table) # accesses the column names
row.names(table) # accesses the row names
scale(table) # converts values to z-score. Be careful… it works by col not row.


########## SAVE #################
# To save a data frame as a file use write.table()
write.table(my_table, file=”new_file.csv”, row.names=FALSE, sep=”\t”, quote= FALSE) # saves the frame to a file

# To save the entire R environment to disc and then reload it use save.image()
save.image(“R_environment_file.rdata”)
load(“R_environment_file.rdata”)
