##### COURSE - Intro to Linux Shell Scripting #######
# https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-shell-scripting-free/learn/lecture/10264328#overview

day1.sh # Create a shell script file
#!/bin/bash
echo "I don't have to be great to start, but I have to start to be great!"
# Will print the line to the console

chmod +x day1.sh
# otherwise get 'permission denied'
# Note, the .sh is fairly irrelevant... 

# Permissions:
-rw-r--r-- jmi45g lainglab 
r = read
w = write
x = execute
- (at start) indicates it's a file. If it was a directory it would be d
jmi45g is the OWNER of the file (ie. me)
lainglab (or jim45g or whatever) is the group able to use the file
So, the owner has permission to read and write, while all other users (group and other) only have 
permision to read. 
In order to run a file you have to have both r and x permissions on the file. 

# cat
cat is short for concatenate
It can be used to print the contents of a file to the screen

# Shebang is #!
Each shell script has to start with a shebang, followed by a path to the program that will interpret and execute the script
#!/bin/bash 
is for bash to interpret your script... 
If you DON'T specify your interpreter with a shebang then it will use the default - all fine until someone else with a different
default tries to use it....

# echo
Just prints something that you've written to it
echo "type txt here"

# type
This gives you what the command type is. 
eg. type echo will return
echo is a shell builtin 
(ie. no external program required)
If you wanted to you could find all different versions of echo on the system using 
type -a echo

# How to create a variable within a shell script and then use it: 
#!/bin/bash
SKILL="shell scripting"
echo "I want to be good at ${SKILL}. That's why I practice."
Variables are simply storage locations that have a name. 
You can think of them as name-value pairs. 
SKILL is the name
shell scripting is the value. 
***NOTE - there are no spaces between the variable name and the value around the = sign!***
Unlike other programming languages the type of value is irrlevant. 
If you make a space then you get an error msg 'command not found'. 
*RULES*
Names can contain letters, digits and underscores
BUT - they can ONLY start with a letter or an underscore - not a digit (number)
Invalid names would be:
3SKILL
A-SKILL (dash)
E@MAIL (@)
The case doesn't matter - could be upper or lower, but convention uses capital letters so they are 
easily picked out in the script
To use a variable do: 
${NAME}
$NAME
If you want to immediately follow the variable name with data bash cannot tell where the variable name
ends UNLESS you use the {}. So, if you had:
echo "${SKILL}is fun"
you would get a result that you ask for
but...
echo "$SKILLis fun"
would jsut return 
fun
because the variable name skillis is not present
The case HAS to match the variable name exactly in the script to your variable name. 

If you put the variable in twice, with different values then the second occurance in the script overwrites 
the first assignment. 
Scripts are always read and executed from the top to the bottom

# Adding comments in your script. 
Soooooo helpful! 
# Add a comment
The only time the # sign is not read as a comment is in a sheband #!
In-line documentation

# Blank lines
Do nothing, but make the script easier to read

# To write a long script, it can help to write in the comments (sudocode) then the code itself 

e.g. 

sysinfo.sh
#!/bin/bash

#This script displyas info about the system on which it is executed

# Tell the user the script is starting
echo "Script is starting"

# Display the hostname of the system
hostname

# Display the current date and time when this info was collected.
date

# Display the kernel release followed by the architecture
uname -r
uname -m

# Display the disk usage in a human readable format
df -h #diskfree

# End the script by letting the user know it's done. 
echo "Script finished"

# Making decisions in a script
#!/bin/bash

# Determine if the user executing this script is the root user or not.

# Display the user ID (note the root user is ALWAYS zero)
echo "Your UID is ${UID}." # UID is a builtin variable of bash

# Display if the user is the root user or not.
if [[ "${UID}" -eq 0 ]] 
# Note the double brackets for if - the command to check is within the [[]]
# Note the SPACE before and after the command! The [[ and ]] cannot abut the 
# command, or if itself. You can have more than one space, but you MUST have the sapce! 
then 
  echo "You are root."
else 
  echo "You are not root."
fi

# In the above you have two blocks of code within the if part 
# the then and the else... Can have multiple lines of code wihtin each. 

# For numbers for if... (arithmetic test operators)
# -eq is equal to
# -ne is not equal
# -lt is less than 
# -gt is greater than
# -ge is greater than or equal to

# If you want to look at strings then you use = sign. 

# You can also use single brackets for if 
if [ command ] 
# but using the two bracket syntax is preferred. 
# You can run into issues with single brackets.
